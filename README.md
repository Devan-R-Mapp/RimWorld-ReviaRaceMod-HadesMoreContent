# RimWorld-ReviaRaceMod
An alien race mod for bloodthirsty foxgirls.

Revia grow stronger with the more humanlike kills they get, which also increases the number of tails they possess. A Revia with no kills to her name is slightly weaker than a baseline human, while those with hundreds to their name and a full set of nine tails is incredibly dangerous and durable. Their lifespan is slightly longer than a human's, though their bloodthirsty nature usually means that they often meet a violent end before they die a natural death. Their society holds a dark god in the highest regard, performing daily sacrifices in the name of a certain deity that sits upon a throne of bleached skulls.

Features:
- Revia are guaranteed to have the Bloodlust trait, and are likely to have some positive degree of the beauty trait.
- Revia never have Wimp. One that cannot fight is soon to die.
- Revia are very likely to have some level of scarring on them.
- Revia have a mechanic that tracks kills. Visually, this can be seen as extra tails, but they also confer a stat bonus in the way of melee damage, damage reduction and health increases. Tiers range from 1 to 9, where 1 represents a Revia with no kills to her name, and 9 is a Revia who has done (2^8 = 256) kills. Ranged kills are counted as only half of a full kill. Downing an opponent does NOT count towards this total; it has to be a killing blow. (WIP)
- Revia may wear any clothing that a baseline human can wear, and will NEVER have any restrictions in regards to equipment. I don't believe in restricting the user's choice in what mods are used; season your own game as you need!
- Revia factions often send out marauding warbands to shed blood in the name of their god. Whether this blood is your colonists', or that of the attacking Revia marauders', matters very little to them -- blood is blood, and they will never retreat.
- Revia factions are hostile to all except for their own race. However, they are still receptive to gifts (read: tribute). Their constant warring and raiding means that they tend to have highly effective weapons and armour for sale, if you somehow satisfy their thirst for plunder.
